bar
It's a sturdy metal bar. A bit on the heavy side to be carrying all day. But I should hold on to it. Just in case.
hat
There's a park emblem sticker on it. There are some scratches on top.  
keycard
It's an RFID key card with a portait of the Red Pac Man Ghost. You can barely make out the name on the front. It reads B_______ B______... I wonder who that is.
net
You feel uneasy looking at the net, let alone holding it. It seems like it might go off at any moment.
postit
It reads Passcode:911. What an ominous passcode
opener
There's a large lock button with a label that reads "Garage Door"
file
There is some highly classified infomation in these files. Better hold on to them for safe keeping.
flashlight
Surprisingly the battery still works. It flickers a bit every now and then. But a few taps against the wall makes the beam solid again.
