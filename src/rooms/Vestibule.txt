Small entryway that leads. There are [locker]s on both sides of the walls, with benches in between. To the left is a door labeled [utility closet]. It is dark inside except for the light coming in from the door you just pried open. One of the lockers appears to be slightly open. To the east you see a door that is slightly open; a foul, rotten smell is emanating through the crack. Above the door you see a sign that reads Mechanical Room. It looks too dark to enter. To the north you see a closed door labeled Lounge, and what looks like a keycard reader next to the door.
