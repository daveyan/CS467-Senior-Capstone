Testing room. It looks like it was here that the functionality of the mechanical animals was tested. There is also a small mechanical [platform] that has a bunch of wires attached to it. You see a few cages with mechanical animals in them, creepily moving their eyes around. You notice an [empty cage] on the south side of the room, and some movement near a door on the east side of the room. The door is labeled Mock Forest, and you see shrubbery through a window.

Testing room full of cages, most closed with mechanical owls inside. One is open, and there is a noise near the east exit to the Mock Forest.

This looks like a recharging station for the owls, and charges them wirelessly. You turn this one off. Hopefully if you find out about others you can turn them off.

You inspect the empty cage, and while doing so hear a noise behind you. You turn to look, and see a large mechanical owl sitting in front of the door to the east. Itâ€™s too dangerous to exit with the owl sitting there freely! It must be trapped.
