This appears to have the machinery necessary to provide energy to the building and keep the equipment running. This includes a furnace, AC unit, and water heater. There are two [dead bodies] near the [power supply] controls just to the left. This must be what is responsible for the foul odor in the previous room. To the east you see a door opening to a vehicle that has its interior light on, and you smell gasoline. Could it be a garage? To the west is the room you came from, the vestibule with lockers.

This looks like the power supply to the whole facility. You flip switch to turn power on, and the room lights up, and you hear equipment start running.

Looks like they suffered head injuries, but how? Nothing around here seems like it would cause it. Hopefully the cause is nowhere nearby.
