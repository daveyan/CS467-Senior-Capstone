Mechanical assembly room. A half assembled owl is on a workbench near a pair of [lenses]. There is also a supply of medium sized batteries, with a [print] out describing their use. To the west is the room with the taxidermied owls that you just came from. To the east is a room filled with parts.
You see the mechanical skeletons of robot owls, and the machinery used to assemble them. Next to a half assembled owl on a workbench you see a pair of [lenses]. You also see a stack of medium sized batteries. One of the batteries is connected to a computer, and the computer’s printer has a [print] out in its tray. To the west is the room with the taxidermied owls, the (Taxidermy Research Room). To the east is a room that you can see is filled with large supplies of individual parts, the (Mechanical Parts Supply Room), probably used in the construction in the mechanical animals, and the researcher’s demise.
You find out that lenses are implanted into the owl’s eyes and are used to record footage of the outside world. By looking at the other equipment around, you can see that this footage is then broadcast back to the facility where the researchers can see the footage in real time.
The print out indicates that the batteries are used to charge the owls, and the charge only lasts about a day, but there is a recharging station in the forest that the owls can go to to recharge. If there are owls still out there, they might be recharging. Maybe there is some way you can change that...
