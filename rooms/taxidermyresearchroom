Research room with taxidermied animals. A large taxidermied [owl] is in an attack pose. There are also [schematics] on desks. To the west is the (Computer Lab) with advanced computers. To the east is the (Robot Assembly Room) with a mechanical owl skeleton.
Research room where mechanical animals seem to be designed. It appears that taxidermied animals were used in their models to guide the design in the shape and size of the animals. A regal [owl] statue is placed prominently on a nearby desk. It is in an attack pose, as if it is hunting down a rabbit. There are also [schematic]s for different designs of mechanical animals. To the west is the (Computer Lab)  with advanced computers. To the east is a room labeled (Robot Assembly Room), where you can see a mechanical owl skeleton.
You see designs for different kinds of birds. How many of the birds in the nearby forest are real? Hopefully there is a way to find out, and deactivate the robotic threats.
You notice the large wing span of the owls, and feel the sharp talons. If the owls were attacking people, the talons must be responsible for causing the head injuries in the victims. This explains the deaths of the victims you encountered earlier on in this facility.
