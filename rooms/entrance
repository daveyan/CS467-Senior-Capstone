A tremor has loosened cracked [stone] that was used to conceal a secret door, a door which as been pried open with a metal bar from the metal [debris]. To the north is the revealed door that leads to the (Vestibule).
You see slabs and slabs of cracked [stone] on the ground, just off of the trail. The slabs are thin, and there is a gap in the piles that reveals what looks like metal, reflecting the midday sun. The recent tremor must have caused the stone to crack and crumble, but why is there metal underneath? How did that get there? There is also a small pile of what looks like mangled metal [debris] at the edge of the cracked stone. To the north is the metal underneath the stone, with the sunlight reflecting off the metal like a signal (what if it was a door leading to some (Vestibule)?).
By inspecting the cracked stone you see that the tremor has caused the stone to move and reveal a hidden door. It is slightly open, and you canâ€™t quite open it with your raw muscles. Maybe something nearby can be used for leverage to get it open?
Pieces that look like they broke off of a building or structure. Mostly large, but there are medium size metal {bar}s that can be picked up. They must have some use.
