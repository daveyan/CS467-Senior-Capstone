There is a couple of [jeep] in here. They have the national park service logo on them, but this place seems too out of the ordinary for them. There are also boxes of stored [documents] on the right wall. To the west is the foul smelling (Mechanical Room), and to the east is the (Exit).
This appears to be where vehicles drive into. Right now there are is a [jeep] in here. At the end of the garage is a large door that is currently closed. There is probably camouflage on the outside of this door just like there was on the outside of the facility entrance.  There are logos are the doors of [jeep]s; it is the national park service logo again. This facility is seeming too weird to belong to them. Off to the right side looks like a storage area, with a rack of boxed up [documents]. To the east is the (Exit) that is currently closed, and to the west is the foul smelling (Mechanical Room).
One of the jeeps has door that is slightly open. The keys are in the jeep, but with the door closed, there wouldn’t be a way to leave.  You also see a {keycard} inside. Maybe it is used to go through the door to the north of the entryway.
Includes pictures of animals you see around the park, but they have mechanical parts implanted in them. Or are they implants? Another document has a receipt for the jeep’s paint job, with a letter next to it explaining the that national park service logo should be painted on the door to not draw attention to the research being done here. So it seems this place doesn’t belong to the national park service as you expected. But who does it belong too, and what do mechanical animals have to do with it?
