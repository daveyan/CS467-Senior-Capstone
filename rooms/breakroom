A break room with a kitchen and small dining area. Near the table is a [dead body] with [feathers nearby]. You initially noticed a {hard hat} and note on the table. To the west is the bathroom, and to the east is the lounge.
Has a kitchen with a fridge and sink. The refrigerator is open. Digital clocks are flashing. There is also a couch and a table with chairs. You see a [dead body] near the table and chair. On top of the table is a {hard hat}. It looks like the dead body was reaching for it before whatever happenedâ€¦ happened. On the table next to the hard hat is a note. There also appears to be what looks like a couple of [feathers] near the body. To the west you see a door leading to the bathroom; it looks like it was heavily damaged, but still holding up. To the east is the lounge you came from.
Looks like they have the same kind of head wound as the others in the mechanical room. The cause of the deaths must be the same, but what is it?
They look like normal bird feathers, but the quill is made of metal.
