A break room with a kitchen and small dining area. Near the table is a dead [body] with [feathers nearby. You initially noticed a hard {hat} and note on the table. To the west is the (Bathroom), and to the east is the (Lounge).
A (mostly) ordinary break room. Has a kitchen with a fridge and sink. The refrigerator is open. Digital clocks are flashing. There is also a couch and a table with chairs; I don’t think anybody will be relaxing here again though. You see another dead [body] near the table and chair. On top of the table is a hard {hat}. It looks like the dead body was reaching for it before whatever happened… happened. There also appears to be what looks like a couple of [feathers] near the body. To the west you see a door leading to the (Bathroom); it looks like the door was heavily damaged, but still holding up. To the east is the well decorated (Lounge) you came from.
They look like normal bird feathers, but the quill is made of metal. Were the feathers a part of an owl like in the documents in the garage? These can’t just be implants… the whole animal must be mechanical. That is the only explanation.
