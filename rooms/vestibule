Small vestibule with [locker]s on either side, and a [utility closet] to the left. One locker is slightly opened. To the east is the mechanical room, and to the north is the lounge.
Small entryway. There are [locker]s on both sides of the walls, with benches in between. To the left is a door labeled [utility closet]. It is dark inside except for the light coming in from the door you just pried open. One of the lockers appears to be slightly open. To the east you see a door that is slightly open; a foul, rotten smell is emanating through the crack. Above the door you see a sign that reads Mechanical Room. It looks too dark to enter. To the north you see a closed door labeled Lounge, and what looks like a keycard reader next to the door.
You see a jacket, pair of boots, some personal belongings. The jacket has the national park emblem on it. Is this a secret facility for the park service?
various supplies such as a first aid kit and a {flashlight}.
