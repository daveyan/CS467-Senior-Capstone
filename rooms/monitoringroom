Screens set up to monitor the mechanical owls. The power to the external charging stations has been turned off. You noticed a desk with a small device on it. To the south is the (Computer Lab) room you came from.
[Screen]s are set up so that whoever is in the monitoring room can see on-screen how the mechanical owls are behaving out in the real forest. One long desk with several chairs sits facing the monitors, and sitting on the desk is a [small device]. Along the west wall is a large switch labeled “Power to External Charging Station”. You flip the switch to turn off the external power supply that is powering the animals. They will no longer be a threat! Everyone is safe from all of the aggressive mechanical owls. Now that you have explored the whole facility, it is time to leave. A small device to the desk next to you may help. To the south is the (Computer Lab) with the advanced computers.
A garage door {opener}, probably used to open the door in the garage housing the jeeps.
You see an owl flying towards a recharging station out in the wild. By turning that off, an owl will no longer be able to recharge.
