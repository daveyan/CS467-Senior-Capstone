Houses the equipment to keep the facility running. There are two [dead bodies] in near the [power supply]. To the east is a (Garage) with the jeep, and to the west is the (Vestibule) you came from.
This appears to have the machinery necessary to provide energy to the building and keep the equipment running. This includes a furnace, AC unit, and water heater. There are two dead [bodies] near the [power] supply controls just to the left. This must be what is responsible for the foul odor in the previous room (and this room as well). What happened here? This facility is getting more mysterious and frightening. To the east you see a room with a vehicle in it that has its interior light on, and you smell gasoline. Could it be a (Garage)? To the west is the (Vestibule) with the lockers.
This looks like the power supply to the whole facility. You flip switch to turn power on, and the room lights up, and you hear equipment start running.
Looks like they suffered head injuries, but how? Nothing around here seems like it would cause it. Hopefully the cause is nowhere nearby.
