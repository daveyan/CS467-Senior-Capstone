Lounge room with couches, TV, and chess board. There is a written [note] by the chess board. There is a bulletin [board] with a warning message on it. To the north is a (Computer Lab). To the east is a (Break Room). To the west is an (Office), and to the south is the (Vestibule).
Open area. Well designed. There are a couple of leather couches, with a nearby OLED TV. There is a table with a chess board out; it looks like a game was in progress, though there are a few knocked over pieces. You see what looks like a written [note] next to the chess board. On the other side of the room is a bulletin[ board]. There is a poster pinned on it that looks like it may be a warning message, judging by the large exclamation mark symbol on it. To the south is the well designed vestibule you came from. To the north is a (Computer Lab) that looks like it if filled with advanced computers. To the east is an ordinary looking (Break Room), with that familiar rotten smell coming from it too. To the west is an (Office) that has a smart and modularized storage system. To the south is the (Vestibule) with the lockers.
Mentions something is up with the mechanical owls, and they are going to the mock forest to check it out. What mechanical owls are they talking about? And what mock forest? This must be a part of some secret research.
Bulletin board suggests wearing hardhats when working with mechanical owls.
