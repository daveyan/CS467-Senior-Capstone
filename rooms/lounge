Lounge room with couches, TV, and chess board. There is a [written note] by the chess board. There is a [bulletin board] with a warning message on it.
Open area. There are a couple of couches, with a nearby TV. There is a table with a chess board out; it looks like the game is in progress. You see what looks like a [written note] next to the chess board. On the other side of the room is a [bulletin board]. There is a poster pinned on it that looks like it may be a warning message, judging by the large exclamation mark symbol on it.
Mentions something is up with the mechanical owls, and they are going to the mock forest to check it out. What mechanical owls are they talking about? And what mock forest? This must be a part of some secret research.
Bulletin board suggests wearing hardhats when working with mechanical owls.
