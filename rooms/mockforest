Large room with a fake forest environment setup for testing. You see a [chipmunk] and a [notebook]. To the west is the (Live Mechanical Animals) room.
Environment setup for testing. It is designed to mimic the outdoors beyond the lab. This is a gymnasium-sized room with low lighting, imitation trees, and the sounds of the forest playing on speakers. You hear a tiny squeaking sound, and see a [chipmunk] by your feet. There is a path through the mock forest, and along the path a short ways into the forest, you can see what looks like a [notebook]. To the west is the (Live Mechanical Animals) room that you came from.
The chipmunkâ€™s head turns robotically and his eyes appear to be zooming in and out while gazing at your face.
Inside the notebook you see a {post it} with a passcode written on it. This could come in handy...
