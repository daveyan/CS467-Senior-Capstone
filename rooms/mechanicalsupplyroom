Supply room. One [bin] has exploding nets in it, another has [talons]. To the east is the (Robot Assembly Room) you just came from.
You see large supplies of individual parts. These are the parts that are used to construct the mechanical animals for research. There are in large bins against the far wall. One of the [bin]s has softball sized metal spheres, with a label reading Use in case of emergencies. Another bin is full of [talons]. There are many other crates that look like they store the materials necessary for the owl construction. The parts look sophisticated and intricate. Clearly a lot of time and money was put into this project. To the east is the (Robot Assembly Room) you just came from.
The bin is full of exploding trap {net}s. These can be thrown in the air, and the a net will expand outward and trap animals. A picture on the bin depicts their use. Is it possible you might have to use one of these at some point?
These are the sharp talons the researchers put onto the owls.  Would this catastrophe would have happened if they used talons that were less sharp...
