Supply room. One bin has exploding nets in it, another has feathers. To the east is the assembly room you just came from.
You see large supplies of individual parts. There are in large bins against the far wall. One of the [bin]s has softball sized metal spheres, with a label reading Use in case of emergencies. Another bin is full of [talons]. There are many other crates that look like they store the materials necessary for the owl construction. To the east is the assembly room you just came from.
The bin is full of {exploding trap net}s. These can be thrown in the air, and the a net will expand outward and trap animals. A picture on the bin depicts their use.
These are the sharp talons the researchers put onto the owls. I wonder if this catastrophe would have happened if they used less sharp...
