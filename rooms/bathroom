Bathroom with a dead body. They were holding a [phone], and have a [camera] next to them. To the east is the (Break Room) with the rotten smell that you came from.
It has three stalls, two sinks, and two mirrors.  The lights turn on automatically when you walk in. Hunched up in the corner, is another dead body. It doesn’t look like they have a head injury like the others though. They are holding a [phone]. Next to the emaciated body is a duffle bag; it is open and you can see a [camera] in it. To the right you see a message pinned to the wall reminding everyone that not washing your hands can spread disease. To the east is the (Break Room) with the body, with the rotten smell.
You listen to a message and find out that the person, along with the dead person in the break room, went into the bathroom to hide from… mechanical owls!. They needed food, so the person who died in the break room went out and was attacked. The person in the bathroom feared leaving, so they starved.
Contains pictures of what looks like real owls in the nearby outdoors. Are those real though? Given what you have learned about what has happened in this place you can’t be sure.
