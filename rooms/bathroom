Bathroom with a dead body. They were holding a [phone], and have a [camera] next to them. To the east is the break room you came from.
At the end of the bathroom. It has three stalls, two sinks, and two mirrors.  Hunched up in the corner, is another dead body. He is holding a [phone]. Next to his emaciated body is a duffle bag; it is open and you can see a [camera] in it. To the right you see a message pinned to the wall reminding everyone that not washing your hands can spread disease. To the east is the break room you came from.
You listen to a message and find out that the person, along with the dead person in the break room, went into the bathroom to hide. They needed food, so the person who died in the break room went out and was attacked. The person in the bathroom feared leaving, so they starved.
Contains pictures of what looks like real owls in the nearby outdoors.
