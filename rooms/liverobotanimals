Testing room full of cages, most closed with mechanical owls inside. One is open, and there is a noise near the east exit to the Mock Forest.
Room where the basic functionality of the robotic animals is tested and assessed. There is a small mechanical [platform] that has a bunch of wires attached to it. It is circular and flat. You see a few cages with mechanical animals in them, creepily moving their eyes around. It looks like they are running out of energy. You notice an empty [cage] on the south side of the room, and some movement near a door on the east side of the room. The door is labeled (Mock Forest), and you see shrubbery through a window. To the west is the (Computer Lab) with advanced computers.
This looks like a recharging station for the owls, and charges them wirelessly. You turn this one off. Hopefully if you find out about others you can turn them off.
You inspect the empty cage, and while doing so noticed there is an owl near the east door. You will want to have a net before moving east in order to trap it and proceed safely!
